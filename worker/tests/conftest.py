Integration tests run against the isolated Neon test database named by
``TEST_DATABASE_URL``, resolved the same way ``db/migrate.py`` resolves its own
connection string. The value is never printed, logged or written anywhere. When
it is not configured (CI, a fresh clone) those tests skip.

Every row a test creates uses a key starting with ``KEY_PREFIX`` and is deleted
again by the ``clean_jobs`` fixture, so tests never touch anyone else's rows.
